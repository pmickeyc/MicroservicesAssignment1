USER STORIES

Sales App User Stories (End-User Perspective)

1. As a sales admin, I want to create a customer profile with contact and address details so I can keep customer records complete.

2. As a sales admin, I want to update customer details so I can keep information accurate over time.

3. As a sales admin, I want to view a single customer quickly so I can check their details before taking action.

4. As a sales admin, I want to list customers with paging so I can browse large customer sets without long load times.

5. As a sales admin, I want to create an order for a specific customer so I can record new sales activity.

6. As a sales admin, I want to edit an order's date, status, or amount so I can correct or progress sales records.

7. As a sales admin, I want to remove an order when created in error so the order history stays clean.

8. As a sales admin, I want to see all orders for one customer so I can review that account's sales history.

9. As a sales admin, I want to filter orders by date range so I can review sales for a period.

10. As a sales admin, I want to filter orders by status so I can focus on pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, or cancelled work.

11. As a sales admin, I want to filter orders by amount range so I can focus on high-value or low-value orders.

12. As a sales admin, I want sorted and paged order lists so I can move through records efficiently.

13. As a sales admin, I want the system to prevent deleting customers that still have orders so I do not lose linked business history by mistake.

14. As a sales admin, I want meaningful validation messages when I enter invalid data so I can fix issues quickly.

15. As a sales admin, I want seeded sample data on startup so I can demo and test workflows immediately.

API Stories (My Perspective as the Developer)

16. As the API developer, I want a clear one-to-many model (Customer -> SalesOrder) so relationship rules are explicit in schema and code.

17. As the API developer, I want a one-to-one CustomerProfile model so I can show richer JPA relationships beyond the baseline.

18. As the API developer, I want DTO-based request/response contracts so internal entities are not exposed directly.

19. As the API developer, I want consistent versioned routes under /api/sales/v1 so clients get a stable contract.

20. As the API developer, I want ISO date handling and validation so date parsing and filtering are reliable.

21. As the API developer, I want consistent pagination metadata in collection responses so frontend/API clients can paginate predictably.

22. As the API developer, I want structured error payloads (timestamp, status, error, message, path, fieldErrors) so consumers can handle failures uniformly.

23. As the API developer, I want correct HTTP semantics (201, 204, 400, 404, 409) so the API behaves according to REST expectations.

24. As the API developer, I want dynamic filtering for orders (date, status, min/max amount) using JPA specifications so queries stay flexible without endpoint sprawl.

25. As the API developer, I want optimistic locking on key entities so concurrent updates are safer.

26. As the API developer, I want indexes on common query fields so paging and filtering stay performant.

27. As the API developer, I want in-memory H2 with startup SQL initialization so the environment is reproducible for demos and grading.

28. As the API developer, I want H2 console access so I can quickly inspect data and verify entity relationships during development.

29. As the API developer, I want automated test runs validating startup and API behavior so I can catch regressions before submission.

30. As the API developer, I want clear README documentation so the lecturer can run, inspect, and evaluate the API with minimal setup friction.
